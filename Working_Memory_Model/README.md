This is the working memory model that I modified for the project.

Model needs to bee run in Python 2.7.18

The main model code is in modelNetwork.py.

Helper functions are in helper.py

Model parameters are in parameters.txt

Three plots will be created when the model is run:
1) This plot represents the decoded cue value.  Notice how it decays decays toward zero
2) This plot is a raster plot for the top 100 spiking neurons
3) THis shows the firing rate for the neurons in preferred and non-preferred directions.
